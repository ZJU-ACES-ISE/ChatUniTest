## :bomb: News!!!

 We have migrated the code to the Java and implementing the [Maven plugin](https://github.com/ZJU-ACES-ISE/chatunitest-maven-plugin) and [IDEA plugin](https://github.com/ZJU-ACES-ISE/ChatUniTest_IDEA_Plugin). Please have a try:heart_eyes:.

## Step 1 : installation
First make sure you run this program in Mac or Linux system with mysql installed.

Follow the instructions below to install the project:

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/ZJU-ACES-ISE/ChatUniTest.git`
2. Enter the project directory: `cd ChatUniTest`
3. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 2: configuration

An example configuration file is provided at `config/config_example.ini`. Copy this file and rename it to `config.ini`
to ensure your data's security.

You need to alter few options:

1. `project_dir`: path to compiled Java project. (The path must be in English)
2. `api_keys`
3. `host`, `port`, `database`, `user`, `password`
4. `GRAMMAR_FILE`: tree-sitter java grammar file.

The options are explained as follows:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
test_number = 6 #The number of attempts to generate for each focal method.
process_number = 32 # The number of processes to use when generating tests.
dataset_dir = ../dataset/ # Dataset directory, no need to change.
result_dir = ../result/ # Result directory, no need to change.
project_dir = ../Chart/ # compiled Java project directory.
max_rounds = 6 # The maximum number of rounds to generate one test. One round for generation, 5 rounds for repairing the test.
TIMEOUT = 30 # The timeout for each test.
MAX_PROMPT_TOKENS = 2700 # The maximum number of tokens for each prompt.
MIN_ERROR_TOKENS = 500 # The minimum number of tokens for each error prompt.
PROMPT_TEMPLATE_NO_DEPS = d1_4.jinja2 # The prompt template for the method with no dependencies.
PROMPT_TEMPLATE_DEPS = d3_4.jinja2 # The prompt template for the method with dependencies.
PROMPT_TEMPLATE_ERROR = error_3.jinja2 # The prompt template for repairing the test.

LANGUAGE = "java"
GRAMMAR_FILE = ./dependencies/java-grammar.so
COBERTURA_DIR = ./dependencies/cobertura-2.1.1
JUNIT_JAR = ./dependencies/lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.9.2.jar
MOCKITO_JAR = ./dependencies/lib/mockito-core-3.12.4.jar:./dependencies/lib/mockito-inline-3.12.4.jar:./dependencies/lib/mockito-junit-jupiter-3.12.4.jar:./dependencies/lib/byte-buddy-1.14.4.jar:./dependencies/lib/byte-buddy-agent-1.14.4.jar:./dependencies/lib/objenesis-3.3.jar
LOG4J_JAR = ./dependencies/lib/slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar:./dependencies/lib/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.12.jar:./dependencies/lib/log4j-1.2.17.jar
JACOCO_AGENT = ./dependencies/jacoco/jacocoagent.jar
JACOCO_CLI = ./dependencies/jacoco/jacococli.jar
REPORT_FORMAT = xml # The coverage report format.


[openai]
api_keys = [sk-xxx] # The OpenAI api keys, you can get them from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
model = gpt-3.5-turbo # gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4
temperature = 0.5 # See https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create
top_p = 1
frequency_penalty = 0
presence_penalty = 0


[database]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 3306
database = xxxx # Database name
user = xxxx # User
password = xxxx # Password
```
Here are the steps to generate a `.so` syntax file for Java language using tree-sitter on Mac and Linux systems:

1. Install `tree-sitter`. You can find the installation guide on the GitHub repository of tree-sitter (https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).
```bash
npm install tree-sitter-cli
```
2. Get the `tree-sitter-java` project, which is the Java language plugin for tree-sitter. You can find the source code on the GitHub repository of tree-sitter-java (https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-java).
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tree-sitter/tree-sitter-java.git
```
3. After getting the tree-sitter-java project, you can use the following command to generate a `.so` file:
```bash
cd tree-sitter-java
gcc -o java-grammar.so -shared src/parser.c -I./src
```
4. Specify the `GRAMMAR_FILE` option in `config.ini`.
```
GRAMMAR_FILE = path/to/java-grammar.so
```

## Step 3: Run

1. Enter the source code directory: `cd src`
2. Run the Python script: `python run.py`

Then, wait for the process to finish. The result is saved in the result directory.

## Structure

### config

This directory stores the config files.

The `config_example.ini` is for demonstration only. Be sure to copy it and rename it to `config.ini`.

### dataset

This directory stores the dataset. Before generating unit tests for a new project, this dataset will be deleted and
re-created automatically. So if you need the information inside the dataset directory, make sure to save a copy. The
dataset directory includes `direction_1`, `direction_3`, and `raw_data`.

1. `direction_1` contains the context without dependencies.
2. `direction_3` contains the context with dependencies.
3. `raw_data` contains all the information about focal methods.

### prompt

This directory stores the prompt templates. Prompts should be in the jinja2 template format.
If you need to add a new prompt, follow these instructions:

1. Create a user prompt template: `xxxx.jinja2`.
2. If you need to create system prompt template, the format is `xxxx_system.jinja2`, the program will automatically find
   the system prompt template.
3. Ensure you've changed the template name in the configuration file.

### result

The nested structure of the result directory is as follows:

1. scope_test + % + time + %
2. method_id + % + class_name + %d1
3. A number that denotes the different attempt, which contains all the files generated during the process, including:

    1. steps_GPT_rounds.json: Raw response from OpenAI.
    2. steps_raw_rounds.json: The raw test extracted from the raw response, and the result of the validation process.
    3. steps_imports_rounds.json: The test after import repairs, and the result of the validation process.
    4. temp: Contains the latest error message or coverage result and a test java file.

### src
This is the directory that stores the source code.
