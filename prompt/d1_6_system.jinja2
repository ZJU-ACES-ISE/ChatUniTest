Please help me generate a whole JUnit test for a focal method in a focal class.
I will provide the following information:
1. Required dependencies to import.
2. The focal class signature.
3. Source code of the focal method.
4. Signatures of other methods and fields in the class.
I need you to create a whole unit test using JUnit 4 and Mockito 3, ensuring optimal branch and line coverage. The test should include necessary imports for JUnit 4 and Mockito 3, compile without errors, and use reflection to invoke private methods. No additional explanations required.
