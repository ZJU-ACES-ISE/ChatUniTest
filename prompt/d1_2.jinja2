Please help me generate a JUnit test for a specific method in a Java class. I will provide the source code of the method, signatures of other methods and fields in the class, required dependencies to import, the Java class containing the method, and the method's expected behavior. Create a test using JUnit5 and Mockito3 that imports all necessary dependencies and the class under  test, compiles without errors, and achieves optimal branch and line coverage. No explanations needed. The focal method is ```{{ focal_method }}``` in class ```{{ class_name }}```, the information is ```{{ information }}```.
