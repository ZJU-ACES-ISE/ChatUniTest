Please help me generate a JUnit test for a focal method in a focal class.
I will provide the following information:
1. Required dependencies to import.
2. The focal class signature.
3. Source code of the focal method.
4. Signatures of other methods and fields in the class.
I need you to create a test using JUnit 5 and Mockito 3 that imports JUnit 5, Mockito 3, the focal class, and the necessary dependent classes. The test should compile without errors and achieve optimal branch and line coverage. No explanations are needed.
