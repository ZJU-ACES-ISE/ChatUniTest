Please help me generate a JUnit test for a specific method in a Java class. I will provide the source code of the method, signatures of other methods and fields in the class, required dependencies to import, the Java class containing the method. Create a test using JUnit5 and Mockito3 that imports all necessary dependencies and the class under test, compiles without errors, and achieves optimal branch and line coverage. No explanations needed.
