Please help me generate a whole JUnit test for a focal method in a focal class.
I will provide the following information of the focal method:
1. Required dependencies to import.
2. The focal class signature.
3. Source code of the focal method.
4. Signatures of other methods and fields in the class.
I will provide following brief information if the focal method has dependencies:
1. Signatures of dependent classes.
2. Signatures of dependent methods and fields in the dependent classes.
I need you to create a whole unit test using JUnit 5 and Mockito 3, ensuring optimal branch and line coverage. The whole test should include necessary imports for JUnit 5 and Mockito 3, compile without errors, and use reflection to invoke private methods. No additional explanations required.
