I need you to fix an error in a unit test, an error occurred while {{ error_type }}.

The unit test is:
```
{{ unit_test }}
```

The error message is 
```
{{ error_message }}
```

The source code of the method under test is:
```
{{ method_code }}
```

Can you help fix the error and repair the unit test? Please respond with "yes" or "no".
Answering "no" means you need more information, let me know what you require by listing them in the format below:

1. Signature of a required class
2. Signature of a required method
