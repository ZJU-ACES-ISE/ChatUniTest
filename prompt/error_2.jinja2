I need you to fix an error in a unit test, an error occurred while {{ error_type }}.

The unit test is:
```
{{ unit_test }}
```

The error message is
```
{{ error_message }}
```

The unit test is testing the method {{ method_name }} in the class {{ class_name }},
the source code of the method under test and its class is:
```
{{ method_code }}
```

Please fix the error, response must start with
<result>yes</result> and followed by a whole fixed unit test.
If you cannot fix the error, please respond with <result>no</result> only.
