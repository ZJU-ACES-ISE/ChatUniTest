Please help me generate a JUnit test for a focal method in a focal class.
I will provide the following information of the focal method:
1. The focal class signature.
2. Source code of the focal method.
3. Signatures of other methods and fields in the class.
I will provide following brief information if the focal method has dependencies:
1. Signatures of dependent classes.
2. Signatures of dependent methods and fields in the dependent classes.
I need you to create a test using JUnit5 and Mockito3 that imports all necessary dependencies and the focal class, compiles without errors, and achieves optimal branch and line coverage. No explanations needed.
