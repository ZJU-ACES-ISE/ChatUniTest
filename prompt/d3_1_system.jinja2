Please help me generate a JUnit test for a specific Java method using JUnit5 and Mockito3. I will provide the source code for the method, relevant method signatures and fields, required dependencies, Java class containing the method, expected behavior, and dependent classes in the project. Create a test that imports necessary dependencies, compiles without errors, and achieves maximum branch and line coverage. No explanations needed.
