Please help me generate a JUnit test for a specific Java method using JUnit5 and Mockito3. I will provide the source code for the method, relevant method signatures and fields, required dependencies, Java class containing the method, and their dependent classes in the project. Create a test that imports necessary dependencies, compiles without errors, and achieves maximum branch and line coverage. No explanations needed.
The focal method is `{{ focal_method }}` in the class `{{ class_name }}`, and the class information is ```{{ full_fm }}```. {% for key, value in c_deps.items() %}
The brief information of involved class {{ key }} is ```{{ value }}```.
{% endfor %}{% for key, value in m_deps.items() %}
The brief information of involved class {{ key }} is ```{{ value }}```.
{% endfor %}
